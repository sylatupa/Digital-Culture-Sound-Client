#X text 689 211 [phasor~] generates a sawtooth waveform scaled from
0 to 1 To produce a triangle wave \, we need to make the wave flip
when it gets to 0.5 (halfway through its cycle) \, so that from this
point the wave will go from 0.5 to 0 To do this \, we need to compare
each sample and tell it that if it's lower than 0.5 \, stay as is \,
if it's higher \, then reverse it (1 - sample value). That gives us
a triangle waveform that goes from 0 to 0.5 and then back to 0 Since
we need to have a bipolar waveform that must be scaled to (-1. to 1.)
\, we need to multiply the samples by 4 (which will give us a triangle
that goes from 0 to 2 to 0) and then subtract 1 so that it goes from
-1 to 1 to -1...;
