TIPS
_______________
-The pitch tracking is glitchy/unpredictable. It doensn't work with chords or multiple notes.
sometimes it just gets it wrong. You may need to adjust the input gain (in main.pd) or the moses 60 value (in octaver.pd) to make it work correctly with your instrument. It was setup for a dual humbucker PRS guitar. 
-Some values may jump between pages, and some pages may not update the knob values at first. These might be fixed but might not
-If you aren't getting sound, check the filter settings on page 1 or page 3 for synth.
-Try Page 6 knob 3 at a high setting and knob 4 at a low setting
-I have not 'pushed' it, but you could probably overload this patch with a combo of delay feedback, granular freeze, reverb freeze, etc. Proceed with caution for your ears/speakers.
-Swap out the files in the /wavs/ folder to find new sounds
